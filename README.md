## Execution Process

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sharathhk122/PG_LIFE-internship-project_WEB_DEVELOPMENT.git
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Frontend

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd PG_LIFE-internship-project_WEB_DEVELOPMENT
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies for the React frontend:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React app on `http://localhost:3000` (or another available port).

### Step 3: Set Up the Backend (PHP & MySQL)

1. Set up a **PHP server** for the backend.
   - You can use **XAMPP** or **WAMP** for local PHP server setup, or configure PHP on your machine directly.
   
2. Create a **MySQL database** and import the necessary tables and data.
   - You may need to configure the PHP backend with your database credentials in the respective PHP files.

3. Ensure the backend API is running to handle user authentication, property listings, and ratings.

### Step 4: Configure the Backend & Frontend Connection

Make sure the React frontend communicates properly with the PHP backend:
- Update the frontend code to interact with the backend API for actions like login, registration, and property management.

### Step 5: Access the Application

Once both the frontend and backend are running, you can access the application by navigating to the React app URL:

```plaintext
http://localhost:3000
```
